Made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds; and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people."},{"number":38,"text":"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah, you adhere heavily to the earth?

And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers."},{"number":50,"text":"If good befalls you, it distresses them; but if disaster strikes you, they say, \"We took our matter [in hand] before,\" and turn away while they are rejoicing."},{"number":51,"text":"Say, \"Never will we be struck except by what Allah has decreed for us; He is our protector.\" And upon Allah let the believers rely."},{"number":52,"text":"Say, \"Do you await for us except one of the two best things while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting.\""},{"number":53,"text":"Say, \"Spend willingly or unwillingly; never will it be accepted from you. Indeed, you have been a defiantly disobedient people.\""},{"number":54,"text":"And what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling."},{"number":55,"text":"So let not their wealth or their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers."},{"number":56,"text":"And they swear by Allah that they are from among you while they are not from among you; but they are a people who are afraid."},{"number":57,"text":"If they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter [and hide], they would turn to it while they run heedlessly."},{"number":58,"text":"And among them are some who criticize you concerning the [distribution of] charities. If they are given from them, they approve; but if they are not given from them, at once they become angry."},{"number":59,"text":"If only they had been satisfied with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and said, \"Sufficient for us is Allah; Allah will give us of His bounty, and [so will] His Messenger; indeed, we are desirous toward Allah,\" [it would have been better for them]."},{"number":60,"text":"Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise."},{"number":61,"text":"And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, \"He is an ear.\" Say, \"[It is] an ear of goodness for you that believes in Allah and believes the believers and [is] a mercy to those who believe among you.\" And those who abuse the Messenger of Allah - for them is a painful punishment."},{"number":62,"text":"They swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers."},{"number":63,"text":"Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger - that for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will abide eternally? That is the great disgrace."},{"number":64,"text":"They hypocrites are apprehensive lest a surah be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock [as you wish]; indeed, Allah will expose that which you fear.\""},{"number":65,"text":"And if you ask them, they will surely say, \"We were only conversing and playing.\" Say, \"Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?\""},{"number":66,"text":"Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you - We will punish another faction because they were criminals."},{"number":67,"text":"The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them [accordingly]. Indeed, the hypocrites - it is they who are the defiantly disobedient."},{"number":68,"text":"Allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. It is sufficient for them. And Allah has cursed them, and for them is an enduring punishment."},{"number":69,"text":"[You disbelievers are] like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion [of worldly enjoyment], and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion, and you have engaged [in vanities] like that in which they engaged. [It is] those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers."},{"number":70,"text":"Has there not reached them the news of those before them - the people of Noah and [the tribes of] 'Aad and Thamud and the people of Abraham and the companions of Madyan and the towns overturned? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. And Allah would never have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves."},{"number":71,"text":"The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise."},{"number":72,"text":"Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from Allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment."},{"number":73,"text":"O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination."},{"number":74,"text":"They swear by Allah that they did not say [anything against the Prophet] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their [pretense of] Islam and planned that which they were not to attain. And they were not resentful except [for the fact] that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His bounty. So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper."},{"number":75,"text":"And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah, [saying], \"If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous.\""},{"number":76,"text":"But when he gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused."},{"number":77,"text":"So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day they will meet Him - because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they [habitually] used to lie."},{"number":78,"text":"Did they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their private conversations and that Allah is the Knower of the unseen?"},{"number":79,"text":"Those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning [their] charities and [criticize] the ones who find nothing [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicule them - Allah will ridicule them, and they will have a painful punishment."},{"number":80,"text":"Ask forgiveness for them, [O Muhammad], or do not ask forgiveness for them. If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times - never will Allah forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."},{"number":81,"text":"Those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah and said, \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intensive in heat\" - if they would but understand."},{"number":82,"text":"So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn."},{"number":83,"text":"If Allah should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to battle], say, \"You will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy.

Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient."},{"number":85,"text":"And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers."},{"number":86,"text":"And when a surah was revealed [enjoining them] to believe in Allah and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, \"Leave us to be with them who sit [at home].\""},{"number":87,"text":"They were satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts were sealed over, so they do not understand."},{"number":88,"text":"But the Messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives. Those will have [all that is] good, and it is those who are the successful."},{"number":89,"text":"Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the great attainment."},{"number":90,"text":"And those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted [to remain], and they who had lied to Allah and His Messenger sat [at home]. There will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment."},{"number":91,"text":"There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."},{"number":92,"text":"Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said, \"I can find nothing for you to ride upon.\" They turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend [for the cause of Allah]."},{"number":93,"text":"The cause [for blame] is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich. They are satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and Allah has sealed over their hearts, so they do not know."},{"number":94,"text":"They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them. Say, \"Make no excuse - never will we believe you. Allah has already informed us of your news.

So leave them alone; indeed they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they had been earning."},{"number":96,"text":"They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them. But if you should be satisfied with them - indeed, Allah is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people."},{"number":97,"text":"The bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what [laws] Allah has revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is Knowing and Wise."},{"number":98,"text":"And among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await for you turns of misfortune. Upon them will be a misfortune of evil. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing."},{"number":99,"text":"But among the bedouins are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to Allah and of [obtaining] invocations of the Messenger. Unquestionably, it is a means of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."},{"number":100,"text":"And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment."},{"number":101,"text":"And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, and [also] from the people of Madinah. They have become accustomed to hypocrisy. You, [O Muhammad], do not know them, [but] We know them.

They had mixed a righteous deed with another that was bad. Perhaps Allah will turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."},{"number":103,"text":"Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah 's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing."},{"number":104,"text":"Do they not know that it is Allah who accepts repentance from His servants and receives charities and that it is Allah who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful?"},{"number":105,"text":"And say, \"Do [as you will], for Allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] His Messenger and the believers.

A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves."},{"number":109,"text":"Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness [with fear] from Allah and [seeking] His approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell?

And Allah is Knowing and Wise."},{"number":111,"text":"Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment."},{"number":112,"text":"[Such believers are] the repentant, the worshippers, the praisers [of Allah], the travelers [for His cause], those who bow and prostrate [in prayer], those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who observe the limits [set by] Allah.

That is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah, nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that is registered for them as a righteous deed. Indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good."},{"number":121,"text":"Nor do they spend an expenditure, small or large, or cross a valley but that it is registered for them that Allah may reward them for the best of what they were doing."},{"number":122,"text":"And it is not for the believers to go forth [to battle] all at once.
