Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Competent."},{"number":71,"text":"And Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal to them therein. Then is it the favor of Allah they reject?"},{"number":72,"text":"And Allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things. Then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of Allah they disbelieve?"},{"number":73,"text":"And they worship besides Allah that which does not possess for them [the power of] provision from the heavens and the earth at all, and [in fact], they are unable."},{"number":74,"text":"So do not assert similarities to Allah.

Can they be equal? Praise to Allah! But most of them do not know."},{"number":76,"text":"And Allah presents an example of two men, one of them dumb and unable to do a thing, while he is a burden to his guardian.

None holds them up except Allah. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe."},{"number":80,"text":"And Allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment; and from their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time."},{"number":81,"text":"And Allah has made for you, from that which He has created, shadows and has made for you from the mountains, shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments which protect you from your [enemy in] battle.

And most of them are disbelievers."},{"number":84,"text":"And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect from every nation a witness. Then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers [to apologize or make excuses], nor will they be asked to appease [Allah]."},{"number":85,"text":"And when those who wronged see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved."},{"number":86,"text":"And when those who associated others with Allah see their \"partners,\" they will say,\" Our Lord, these are our partners [to You] whom we used to invoke besides You.\" But they will throw at them the statement, \"Indeed, you are liars.\""},{"number":87,"text":"And they will impart to Allah that Day [their] submission, and lost from them is what they used to invent."},{"number":88,"text":"Those who disbelieved and averted [others] from the way of Allah - We will increase them in punishment over [their] punishment for what corruption they were causing."},{"number":89,"text":"And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves. And We will bring you, [O Muhammad], as a witness over your nation. And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims."},{"number":90,"text":"Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded."},{"number":91,"text":"And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have taken it, [O believers], and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made Allah, over you, a witness. Indeed, Allah knows what you do."},{"number":92,"text":"And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong [by] taking your oaths as [means of] deceit between you because one community is more plentiful [in number or wealth] than another community. Allah only tries you thereby. And He will surely make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you used to differ."},{"number":93,"text":"And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do."},{"number":94,"text":"And do not take your oaths as [means of] deceit between you, lest a foot slip after it was [once] firm, and you would taste evil [in this world] for what [people] you diverted from the way of Allah, and you would have [in the Hereafter] a great punishment."},{"number":95,"text":"And do not exchange the covenant of Allah for a small price. Indeed, what is with Allah is best for you, if only you could know."},{"number":96,"text":"Whatever you have will end, but what Allah has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do."},{"number":97,"text":"Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do."},{"number":98,"text":"So when you recite the Qur'an, [first] seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy]."},{"number":99,"text":"Indeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord."},{"number":100,"text":"His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah."},{"number":101,"text":"And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse - and Allah is most knowing of what He sends down - they say, \"You, [O Muhammad], are but an inventor [of lies].\" But most of them do not know."},{"number":102,"text":"Say, [O Muhammad], \"The Pure Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims.\""},{"number":103,"text":"And We certainly know that they say, \"It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet.\" The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur'an is [in] a clear Arabic language."},{"number":104,"text":"Indeed, those who do not believe in the verses of Allah - Allah will not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment."},{"number":105,"text":"They only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of Allah, and it is those who are the liars."},{"number":106,"text":"Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief... except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from Allah, and for them is a great punishment;"},{"number":107,"text":"That is because they preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter and that Allah does not guide the disbelieving people."},{"number":108,"text":"Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision Allah has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless."},{"number":109,"text":"Assuredly, it is they, in the Hereafter, who will be the losers."},{"number":110,"text":"Then, indeed your Lord, to those who emigrated after they had been compelled [to renounce their religion] and thereafter fought [for the cause of Allah] and were patient - indeed, your Lord, after that, is Forgiving and Merciful"},{"number":111,"text":"On the Day when every soul will come disputing for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged."},{"number":112,"text":"And Allah presents an example: a city which was safe and secure, its provision coming to it in abundance from every location, but it denied the favors of Allah. So Allah made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing."},{"number":113,"text":"And there had certainly come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him; so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers."},{"number":114,"text":"Then eat of what Allah has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And be grateful for the favor of Allah, if it is [indeed] Him that you worship."},{"number":115,"text":"He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."},{"number":116,"text":"And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, \"This is lawful and this is unlawful,\" to invent falsehood about Allah. Indeed, those who invent falsehood about Allah will not succeed."},{"number":117,"text":"[It is but] a brief enjoyment, and they will have a painful punishment."},{"number":118,"text":"And to those who are Jews We have prohibited that which We related to you before. And We did not wrong them [thereby], but they were wronging themselves."},{"number":119,"text":"Then, indeed your Lord, to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves - indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful."},{"number":120,"text":"Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah."},{"number":121,"text":"[He was] grateful for His favors. Allah chose him and guided him to a straight path."},{"number":122,"text":"And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous."},{"number":123,"text":"Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate with Allah."},{"number":124,"text":"The sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it. And indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ."},{"number":125,"text":"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided."},{"number":126,"text":"And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed. But if you are patient - it is better for those who are patient."},{"number":127,"text":"And be patient, [O Muhammad], and your patience is not but through Allah.
